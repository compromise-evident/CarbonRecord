Version 1.0.1   Universal drag-n-drop; gets path then fixes it if drag-n-dropped
Device  2       regardless of single-quote presence & "enter" not being cleared,
                meaning you can have options before it where user presses enter.

Version 1.0.0   Previous use of a brushed motor resulted in that motor misfiring
Device  2       every long once in a while. I guess graphite brushes are not for
                jerking action. v2 uses an electromagnet of a 12-volt automotive
                relay,  pulling a metal  slammer. Placing a magnet on top of the
                slammer allows it to slam with a much greater force. The slammer
                bottom is sharpened into a short blade.

Version 1.0.0   Uses synchronous  microwave  motor for consistent line pull. The
Device  1       second motor skeleton is only used as a  resistor  via its coils
                so the denting-motor does not tear up the line.The mechanism for
                winding the line back up is purposely permissive in slip so that
                the line remains tight but not pulled more than given by puller.
                0 bits are displayed in case you wish to dent for 0 as well, but
                with a force or style different from 1 bits.  Power is necessary
                due to the line springing, twisting,  factory-wound with stress,
                winder-side springing, and dents forcing the line to spring; all
                the over-built and over-powered  design is actually much needed.
