For denting the line, I'll over-power off-set motors but in short bursts where they
only jerk rather than spin. The motors will be interrupted by photoresistors taped to a
laptop screen, in a black terminal having symbols rolling for light (as I had done for
RICINkeyboard.) I have tested the switching, it's responsive.
