For denting the line, I'll over-power off-set motors but in short bursts where they
only jerk rather than spin. The motors will be interrupted by photoresistors taped to a
laptop screen, in a black terminal having symbols rolling for light (as I had done for
RICINkeyboard.) I have tested the switching, it's
[responsive.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/compromise-evident/CarbonRecord/main/Other/5V-relay.png)
Note that fishing lines will curl in response to the denting; into the direction of where
dents appear. v2 means lighter denting action, which does not deform the line too much.
And the denting is applied as drawn--on the inner side of the line if treated as a ring.
