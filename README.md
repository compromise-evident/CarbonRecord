# Progress

Line puller & winder complete. Building denting-tools (mostly waiting for another 5V relay.)

For denting the line, I'll over-power these off-set motors but in short bursts where they
only jerk rather than spin. The motors will be interrupted by photoresistors taped to a
laptop screen, in a black terminal having symbols rolling for light (as I had done for
RICINkeyboard.) I have tested this and switching is quite fast and responsive. I had also
tested more relay stuff and made an explainer that you should familiarize yourself with,
and maybe acquire such [PCBs](https://github.com/compromise-evident/CarbonRecord/blob/main/Other/5V-relay.png) as they are useful.

# Update

Actually, I'll use 1 motor but on 2 circuits; one hits hard while the other is lightly-resisted. Now the motor can make 2 different dents, and I get to save one motor for if the other burns, I'll know to reduce power or provide better cooling.
