Brushed motors are meant to spin, not jerk; every long once in a while it was unresponsive hence version 2.

# WARNING

Physically damaging fishing line causes it to warp dramatically away from its natural spring of being
wound onto a spool. I had tried to let it fall like coiling honey into a bucket but it kept flipping
and turning. You'll ABSOLUTELY NEED a strong winder that is permissive to slip as I have
installed--slippery silicone against a slippery pen where some friction is still present.

# To preserve something authorities can't kill by waiting

Fluorocarbon fishing line won't degrade for a few thousand years, it's cheap, and easy to "write on."

<br>
<br>

# To preserve something authorities can't kill remotely

Fluorocarbon fishing line should survive EMPs and the light of WW3 if buried, as well as solar flares
(unlike microelectronics, metals, capacitors, magnets, and electron microbuckets of SSDs.)

<br>
<br>

# To preserve something authorities can't confiscate

Fluorocarbon fishing line should be a nightmare to search for if buried. Just tie the winding
as a ring using more fluorocarbon fishing line, rather than using a spool of a different material.
